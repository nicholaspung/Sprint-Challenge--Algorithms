## Exercise I

a) O(n) - Loops with an unknown variable give off an O(n) time complexity. In addition, for n+1, it only runs an extra 1 time, making the runtime linear.


b) O(n) - Although we have a nested loops, which means O(n^2), the second loops terminates after running once in this instance. As n gets bigger, it adds an extra 1 runtime time, making the runtime linear.


c) O(n) - As bunnies grows bigger, it adds a constant number of operations, ex. 1 comparison, 1 addition, and 1 subtraction. This makes the runtime linear.
